# Notes

So...

need to refactor based on new endpoint config

need to look again at platform logos. playstation one is incorrect, for example, it has PSOne logo not original PSX logo. May need to look at platform versions and get earliest version - that's a new endpoint config.

Also. Something else to think about, esp. regarding the early computer stuff - multiplatform releases. the same game might have been released on different systems, and I really only want the 'best' version of each game. like... Flimbo's Quest https://www.igdb.com/games/flimbos-quest: which platform has the definitive version of this game? Or Speedball 2 https://www.igdb.com/games/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe: that came out on a FORKTON of systems.
