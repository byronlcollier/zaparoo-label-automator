# Zaparoo Label Automation - EXPERIMENTAL

Hello!

How did you find this project?

This is a highly experimental project to automate the creation of labels for the [Zaparoo](https://zaparoo.org/) project. The goal is to fully automate the creation of labels that are ready for printing on to 'credit card' sized NFC cards/card labels.

It gets 'platforms' - i.e. consoles or computers - listed in a CSV file, matches it up to [Internet Game Database](https://www.igdb.com/), then finds the top-rated 𝑛 games for that platform. Later I will add functionality to specify a CSV file for specific games on specific platforms, but that needs a bit more work. Also at the moment it requires that you know the Platform ID for that system, which you only get by searching IGDB. That's not really ideal, it'd be better to have some kind of 'search' against the API, but that's also a bit tricky to achieve. The IGDB API is pretty damn powerful, it's got a lot more features than your typical 'U GIVE ME INFO I GIVE U RESPONSE' REST API. That's _why_ this is highly experimental and really only intended for my own use 😉.

I'm really only building this for myself but my Educational GitHub license is coming to an end, so I'd better get used to having my repos be public.

I'm flattered if you find this useful, but rather than forking I'd prefer it if you open an issue to discuss it if you'd like to change something or make a suggestion. Let's at least open a dialogue 🙂. But it's licensed under 'CC BY-NC 4.0', so I can't stop you forking it... though it'd be a dick move if you didn't credit me 😉 and I would object quite strongly if this somehow ends up in a commercial project. Making money off the back of my work without so much as an acknowledgement is _not cool_.

There's a lot of AI-generated stuff in here, so it's _hideously_ over-complicated and there are likely to be bugs. Yes, yes, I know, I know, I hate that shite as much as you do. But treat it like a toddler on a sugar rush wielding a baseball bat - watch it carefully, check what it's doing, "correct" it's mistakes, etc. If this ever gets to a state where it looks like it's 'done', you can rest assured that the 'final' version of the repo will be _thoroughly_ scoured by my own hand 😉.
